- Introduction
    - About this talk
    - Why should you care?
    - Who am I?
- Trivial examples of types for correctness
    - Mutable vs. immutable collections in Objective-C
    - NSData -> NSString
    - Optionals
    - Array<T>
- Unit tests vs. types
- Example: validation
    - String, Int, etc. allow invalid values
    - Creating a more restricted type proves that you have validated a given value
    - JSON parsing into model objects is like validation
- Phantom types
    - http://www.objc.io/snippets/13.html
    - [Validation with phantom types](https://wiki.haskell.org/Phantom_type)
- Case study: errors in ReactiveCocoa
    - Background about signals and events
    - Assertion failures in property binding in RAC 2
    - ErrorType
    - NoError phantom type
    - Property binding in RAC 3
- Case study: IO monad in Haskell?
- Case study: STM monad in Haskell?
- Example: threading in the type system?
